The Invisible Office is taking the developing COVID-19 situation seriously and has put policies in place to ensure the safety of our staff and clients.

As of Monday 23 March, our office has closed and our team is working remotely.

While our team is working remotely, business continues as usual.

We can still be contacted on the usual phone number and email addresses.
