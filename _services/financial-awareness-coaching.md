We’ll help you to understand your business better, enabling you to better manage your cash flow.  Good management decisions rely on a sound understanding of the financial implications for your business.  This service involves meeting with us every two months to discuss your financial results, culminating in you learning to produce and interpret your own customised financial reports on a monthly basis.
