The Life Organiser has been designed to provide peace of mind that your affairs are in order and to minimise stress for your loved ones in the event of disability or death.  It is a structured central register for you to complete, covering a raft of personal, financial, property, insurance and business details that should be documented and stored securely.

You can simply purchase the Life Organiser and complete it yourself or have a review meeting where we’ll manage the process and advise you of any actions we think would benefit you and your estate.  Upon completion of your Life Organiser we’ll store an electronic copy for you - to be reviewed annually when we meet to discuss your financials.
