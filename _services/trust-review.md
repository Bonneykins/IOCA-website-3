The robustness of family trusts is coming under considerable scrutiny as a result of the recent Law Commission review, resulting in a massive wakeup call for Trustees.  Our Trust Review service examines your trust set up, identifies any administration gaps, ensures your Trust is compliant with legislation and that trustees are meeting their obligations.  
Weâ€™ve developed a number of resources and templates to help you to understand this complicated topic and to help you develop an effective Memorandum of Wishes.  Most importantly, this service provides a framework to ensure your Trust is meeting its objectives.
