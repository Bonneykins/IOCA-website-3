If you’re keen to improve your business performance and financial results but don’t feel you are being supported enough by your current accountant - give us a call.  We’ll arrange a complimentary Proactive Accounting Meeting to review your unique situation and discuss how we may be able to support you.  

During the meeting we’ll identify your burning issues, opportunities and potential tax efficiencies, and establish goals and strategies to achieve them. We’ll also have a strategic discussion around the current and future direction of your entities.

Following the meeting, if required, we’ll prepare a proposal for services, with all costs priced upfront, whether this be strictly for Business Development work and / or compliance.
