 As a valued client, you’ll receive at least one Complimentary Client Review meeting (CCR).  In fact, this is an annual event for a number of our clients.  The CCR is an opportunity for you to set and review your goals and gives you clarity around the actions you need to take to achieve those goals.  It also stimulates strategic discussion and identifies burning issues, opportunities and challenges so that you respond effectively.  And of course, it’s an opportunity for our team to identify greater tax efficiencies and asset protection.
